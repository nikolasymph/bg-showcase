# Showcase 

This is mono-repo project demonstrating various technologies.

# Some initial organization

Since we will be hosting multiple interconnected sub-projects in this repository, and services will be written in different 
languages, and require different version of things, everything in showcase will be based on containers, thus the only two requirements
for building the system are:

* Working version of Docker Desktop for your operating system and
* Git Client

Rest of the tools are sub project dependent, so if you need to make change in any of the subprojects, go to readme file there and see what's required to successfully edit code localy.
